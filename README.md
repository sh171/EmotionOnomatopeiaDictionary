# Emotion Onomatopoeia Dictionary

## Overview
The Emotion Onomatopoeia Dictionary is an interactive project aimed at familiarizing users with the Document Object Model (DOM) to create a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI). This GUI allows users to seamlessly browse and view data sets within the application.

## Description
The core functionality of this application centers around displaying a variety of emotion categories. Upon selecting an emotion from a category, users are navigated to a detailed section dedicated to that emotion. Here, they are presented with a curated card featuring onomatopoeic words that resonate with the chosen emotion.
